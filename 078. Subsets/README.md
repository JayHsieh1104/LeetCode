# 078. Subsets

## Solution 1

Use backtracking method to generate all of the possible subset.

* Time Complexity: O(N*2^N), N is the number of elements in the collection.

* Space Complexity: O(N*2^N)

## Solution 2 -- Cascading

* Time Complexity: O(N*2^N), N is the number of elements in the collection.

* Space Complexity: O(N*2^N)

## Solution 3 -- Bitmask

* Time Complexity: O(N*2^N), N is the number of elements in the collection.

* Space Complexity: O(N*2^N)
