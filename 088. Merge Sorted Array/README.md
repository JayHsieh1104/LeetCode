# 088. Merge Sorted Array
## Solution 1 -- Optimal solution
Use two pointer to select the bigger element from the two array, and then place it from the right side of nums1
* Time Complexity: O(N)
* Space Complexity: O(1)

## Solution 2
Use two pointer to select the bigger element from the two array, and then place it from the left side of nums1
* Time Complexity: O(N)
* Space Complexity: O(N)
