# 695. Max Area of Island

## Solution 1

Use DFS to iteratively solve the problem

* Time Complexity: O(R * C), R = row, C = column

* Space Complexity: O(R * C), R = row, C = column

## Solution 2

Use DFS to recursively solve the problem

* Time Complexity: O(R * C), R = row, C = column

* Space Complexity: O(R * C), R = row, C = column
