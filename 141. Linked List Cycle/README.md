# 141. Linked List Cycle

## Solution 1 -- Set

* Time Complexity: O(N)

* Space Complexity: O(N)

## Solution 2 -- Two Pointers

Use one slower pointer and one faster pointer to solve the problem. Imagine two runners running on the same track at different speed.

* Time Complexity: O(N)

* Space Complexity: O(1)
