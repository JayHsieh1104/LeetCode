# 129. Sum Root to Leaf Numbers

## Solution 1 Iterative DFS

* Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of total nodes in the tree.

* Space Complexity: O(H), where H is the height of the tree.

## Solution 2 Recursion DFS

* Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of total nodes in the tree.

* Space Complexity: O(H), where H is the height of the tree.
