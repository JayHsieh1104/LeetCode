# 243. Shortest Word Distance

## Solution 1 -- Brute Force

* Time Complexity: O(N*M), N is the number of times that word1 in words list, M is the number of times that word2 in words list.

* Space Complexity: O(N+M)

## Solution 2 -- Cascading

* Time Complexity: O(N*2^N), N is the number of elements in the collection.

* Space Complexity: O(N*2^N)

## Solution 3 -- Bitmask

* Time Complexity: O(N*2^N), N is the number of elements in the collection.

* Space Complexity: O(N*2^N)
