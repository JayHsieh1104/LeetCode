# 046. Permutations

## Solution 1 -- Backtracking-1

Use backtracking method to generate all of the possible permutations.

* Time Complexity: O(N*N!), N is the number of elements in the collection.

* Space Complexity: O(N*N!), we need to store N! solutions, each solution has at most N chars.

## Solution 2 -- Backtracking-2

Use backtracking method to generate all of the possible permutations.

* Time Complexity: O(N*N!), N is the number of elements in the collection.

* Space Complexity: O(N*N!), we need to store N! solutions, each solution has at most N chars.
