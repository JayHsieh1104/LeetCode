# 445. Add Two Numbers II

## Solution 1 -- Stack

Walk through all of the element in the two list and use two stack to contain all the visited elements. Then, keep pop element from the two stack and build the merged list.

* Time Complexity: O(M + N)

* Space Complexity: O(M + N)

## Solution 2 -- Reverse Linked List and then Add the two lists

* Time Complexity: O(M + N)

* Space Complexity: O(1)
