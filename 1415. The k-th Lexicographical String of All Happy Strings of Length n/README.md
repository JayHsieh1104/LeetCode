# 1415. The k-th Lexicographical String of All Happy Strings of Length n

## Solution 1 -- Mathematical approach

* Time Complexity: O(N), where N is given from the problem.

* Space Complexity: O(N), for N depth of recursion

## Solution 2 -- DFS

TODO:

* Time Complexity: O(NK), where N is given from the problem.

* Space Complexity: O(N)
