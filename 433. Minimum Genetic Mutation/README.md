# 433. Minimum Genetic Mutation

## Solution 1 -- BFS

* Time Complexity: O((N^2)*M), where N is the length of the bank array and M is the length of a genetic string.

* Space Complexity: O(N^2)

## Solution 2 -- DFS

TODO:

* Time Complexity: O(), where N is the length of the bank array.

* Space Complexity: O()
