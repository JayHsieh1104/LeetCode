# 433. Minimum Genetic Mutation

## Solution 1 -- BFS

* Time Complexity: O(N^2), where N is the length of the bank array.

* Space Complexity: O(N + M^2), where M is the length of a gene string.

## Solution 2 -- DFS

TODO:

* Time Complexity: O(N^2), where N is the length of the bank array.

* Space Complexity: O(N)
