# 98. Validate Binary Search Tree

## Solution 1 -- Recursive Traversal with Valid Range

* Time Complexity: O(N)

* Space Complexity: O(N)

## Solution 2 -- Iterative Traversal with Valid Range

The idea is same as solution 1, but use DFS and stack to replace recursion.

* Time Complexity: O(N)

* Space Complexity: O(N)

## Solution 3 - Recursive Inorder Traversal

Based on the feature of binary search tree, if we run an inorder traversal, the visited numbers will form an ascending order.

* Time Complexity: O(N)

* Space Complexity: O(N)

## Solution 4 - Iterative Inorder Traversal

Based on the feature of binary search tree, if we run an inorder traversal, the visited numbers will form an ascending order.

* Time Complexity: O(N)

* Space Complexity: O(N)
