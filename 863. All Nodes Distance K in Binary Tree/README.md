# 863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree

## Solution 1 -- DFS + BFS

* Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.

* Space Complexity: O(N)

## Solution 2 -- Sort + Two Pointers

* Time Complexity: O(NlogN), where N is the length of the nums list

* Space Complexity: O(N)
