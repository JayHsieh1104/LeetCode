# 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

## Solution 1 -- Brute force

* Time Complexity: O(N^3), where N is the length of the list

* Space Complexity: O(1)

## Solution 2 -- Sorting

* Time Complexity: O(NlogN), where N is the length of the list

* Space Complexity: O(1)

## Solution 3 -- Set

* Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the list

* Space Complexity: O(N)
