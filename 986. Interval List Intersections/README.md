# 986. Interval List Intersections

## Solution 1 -- Two pointers

* Time Complexity: O(M + N), where M, N are the length of A and B respectively.

* Space Complexity: O(M + N)

## Solution 2 -- Improved from approach 1

* Time Complexity: O(M + N), where M, N are the length of A and B respectively.

* Space Complexity: O(M + N)
