## Solution 1 -- Greedy

* Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of S.

* Space Complexity: O(K), where K is the space for containing the a-z characters.

## Solution 2 -- Optimized from solution 1

* Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of S.

* Space Complexity: O(K), where K is the space for containing the a-z characters.
