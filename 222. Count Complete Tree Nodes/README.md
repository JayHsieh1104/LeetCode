# 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

## Solution 1 -- DFS

* Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of total nodes in the tree.

* Space Complexity: O(H), where H is the height of the complete tree.

## Solution 2 -- Binary Search

* Time Complexity: O((logN)^2), where N is the depth of the complete tree.

* Space Complexity: O(1)
