## Solution 1 -- Brute Force (TLE)

* Time Complexity: O(N^3)

* Space Complexity: O(1)

## Solution 2 -- Better Brute Force  (TLE)

* Time Complexity: O(N^2)

* Space Complexity: O(1)

## Solution 3 -- Divide and Conquer  (TLE)

* Time Complexity:
  * Average case: O(NlogN)
  * Worst case: O(N^2), where the given array is sorted by ascending order.

* Space Complexity: O(N)
