# 206. Reverse Linked List

## Solution 1

Use a stack to record the visited elements and then build a linked list by pop the elements from the stack.

* Time Complexity: O(N)

* Space Complexity: O(N)

## Solution 2

Use two pointer (previous, curent) to build iteratively a reverse linked list.

* Time Complexity: O(N)

* Space Complexity: O(1)

## Solution 3

Build a reverse linked list via recursion.

* Time Complexity: O(N)

* Space Complexity: O(N)
