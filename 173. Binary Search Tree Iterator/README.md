# 173. Binary Search Tree Iterator

## Solution 1 -- Inorder traversal

* Time Complexity:
  * Next: O(1), where N is the length of given binary search tree.
  * hasNext: O(1)

* Space Complexity: O(N)

## Solution 2 -- Brute Force

* Time Complexity:
  * Next: O(1), averagely
  * hasNext: O(1)

* Space Complexity: O(logH)
