# 912. Sort an Array

## Solution 1

Merge sort

* Time Complexity: O(NlogN)
* Space Complexity: O(1)

## Solution 2

Selection sort

* Time Complexity: O(N^2)
* Space Complexity: O(1)

## Solution 3

Bubble sort

* Time Complexity: O(N^2)
* Space Complexity: O(1)

## Solution 4

Quick sort

* Time Complexity: O(NlogN) in average case, when partition evenly. O(N^2) in worst case, when always partion on one side, just like selection sort.
* Space Complexity: O(1)

## Solution 5

Heap sort

* Time Complexity: O(NlogN)
* Space Complexity: O(1)
