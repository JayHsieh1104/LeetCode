# 572. Subtree of Another Tree

## Solution 1 -- DFS + Find Substring

* Time Complexity: O(M+N + M*N), where M is the number of nodes in the tree s and N is the number of nodes in the tree t.

* Space Complexity: O(M+N)

## Solution 2 -- Recursion

* Time Complexity: O(M*N), where M is the number of nodes in the tree s and N is the number of nodes in the tree t.

* Space Complexity: O(N)
