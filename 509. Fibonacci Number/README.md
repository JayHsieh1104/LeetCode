# 509. Fibonacci Number

## Solution 1 -- Recursion

* Time Complexity: O(2^N), where N is the given number

* Space Complexity: O(N), the depth of memory stack is N

## Solution 2 -- Bottom-Up Approach using Memoization

* Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the nums array

* Space Complexity: O(N)

## Solution 3 -- Top-Down Approach using Memoization

* Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the nums array

* Space Complexity: O(N)

## Solution 4 -- Iterative Bottom-Up Approach

* Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the nums array

* Space Complexity: O(1)
