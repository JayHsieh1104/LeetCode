# 987. Vertical Order Traversal of a Binary Tree

## Solution 1 -- Sort + BFS

* Time Complexity: O(NlogN), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.

* Space Complexity: O(N)

## Solution 2 -- Sort + DFS

* Time Complexity: O(NlogN), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.

* Space Complexity: O(N)

## Solution 3 -- BFS/DFS with Partition Sorting

TODO:

* Time Complexity: O(), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.

* Space Complexity: O()
