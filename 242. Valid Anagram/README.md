## Solution 1 -- Sorting

* Time Complexity: ONlogN), where N is the length of given string.

* Space Complexity: O(1)

## Solution 2 -- Counter

* Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of given string.

* Space Complexity: O(1), the used space is constant because the size of used characters is in constant size.
