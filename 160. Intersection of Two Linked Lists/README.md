# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists

## Solution 1 -- Brute Force (TLE)

* Time Complexity: O(MN), where M is the number of nodes in list A and N is the number of nodes in list B

* Space Complexity: O(1)

## Solution 2 -- Set

* Time Complexity: O(M+N), where M is the number of nodes in list A and N is the number of nodes in list B

* Space Complexity: O(M) or O(N)

## Solution 3 -- Two Pointers

* Time Complexity: O(M+N), where M is the number of nodes in list A and N is the number of nodes in list B

* Space Complexity: O(1)

## Solution 4

* Time Complexity: O(M+N), where M is the number of nodes in list A and N is the number of nodes in list B

* Space Complexity: O(1)
