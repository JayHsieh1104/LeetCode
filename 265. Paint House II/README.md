# 265. Paint House II

## Solution 1 -- DP

* Time Complexity: O(NK), where N is the number of rows in the array and K is the number of color types.

* Space Complexity: O(K)

## Solution 2 -- DP with Optimized Space (In Place)

* Time Complexity: O(NK), where N is the number of rows in the array and K is the number of color types.

* Space Complexity: O(1)

## Solution 3 -- DP with Optimized Space without modifying input

TODO:

* Time Complexity: O(NK), where N is the number of rows in the array and K is the number of color types.

* Space Complexity: O(1)

## Solution 4 -- Recursion with Memorization

TODO:

* Time Complexity: O(N*K^2), where N is the length of the bank array.

* Space Complexity: O(NK)
