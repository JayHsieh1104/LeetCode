# 1570. Dot Product of Two Sparse Vectors

## Solution 1 -- Brute Force

* Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the input array.

* Space Complexity: O(1)

## Solution 2 -- Index-Value Pairs

* Time Complexity: O(N)

* Space Complexity: O(min(L1, L2)), where L is the number of non-zero elements in a input array.
