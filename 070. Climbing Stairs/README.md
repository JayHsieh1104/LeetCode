# 070. Climbing Stairs
## Solution 1 - Brute Force (Recursion)
* Time Complexity: O(2^N)
* Space Complexity: O(N)

## Solution 2 - Recursion with memoization
To avoid redundantly calculating the result for every step, we can store those results in an array.
* Time Complexity: O(N)
* Space Complexity: O(N)

## Solution 3 - Dynamic Programming
We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem if the progblem can be broken into subproblem with simailr optimal substructure.
* Time Complexity: O(N)
* Space Complexity: O(N)
