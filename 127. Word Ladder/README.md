# 127. Word Ladder

## Solution 1 -- BFS (TLE)

* Time Complexity: O(N^2*M), where N is the size of the word list and M is the maximum length of a word.

* Space Complexity: O(N^2)

## Solution 2 -- BFS

* Time Complexity: O(M^2*N), where N is the size of the word list and M is the maximum length of a word.

* Space Complexity: O(M^2*N)

## Solution 3 -- Bidirectional BFS

TODO:

* Time Complexity: O(M^2*N), where N is the size of the word list and M is the maximum length of a word.

* Space Complexity: O(M^2*N)
