# 1123. Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves

## Solution 1 -- Record the depth of each nodes and find the lowest common ancestor

* Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.

* Space Complexity: O(N)

## Solution 2 -- Recursion

Combine the dfs and answer functions in solution 1 into one function

* Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.

* Space Complexity: O(N)
