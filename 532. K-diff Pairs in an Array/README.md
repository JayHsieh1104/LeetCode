# 532. K-diff Pairs in an Array

## Solution 1 -- Brute Force (TLE)

* Time Complexity: O(N^2), where N is the length of the nums list

* Space Complexity: O(N)

## Solution 2 -- Sort + Two Pointers

* Time Complexity: O(NlogN), where N is the length of the nums list

* Space Complexity: O(N)

## Solution 3 -- Hashset

* Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the nums list

* Space Complexity: O(N)
