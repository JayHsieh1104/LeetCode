# 148. Sort List

## Solution 1 -- Merge Sort (Top to Bottom)

* Time Complexity: O(NlogN), where N is the length of the linked list.

* Space Complexity: O(logN), used for do recursion in stack memory.

## Solution 2 -- Merge Sort (Bottom to Top)

TODO: Hard Problem.

* Time Complexity: O(NlogN), N is the length of the linked list.

* Space Complexity: O(1)
