# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

## Solution 1 -- Recursion

* Time Complexity: O(N)

* Space Complexity: O(N), in worst case, the depth of recursion could be N.

## Solution 2 -- Iterative using parent pointers

* Time Complexity: O(N)

* Space Complexity: O(N), space for each node's parent node and seen nodes.
