# 332. Reconstruct Itinerary

## Solution 1 -- Backtracking + Greedy

* Time Complexity: O(E^D), where E is number of the tickets and D the is maximum depth of route from JKE to the last destination.

* Space Complexity: O(E+V), where E is number of the tickets and V is the number of the airports.

## Solution 2 -- Eulerian path (Hierholzer's Algorithm)

TODO:

* Time Complexity: O(), where N is given from the problem.

* Space Complexity: O()
