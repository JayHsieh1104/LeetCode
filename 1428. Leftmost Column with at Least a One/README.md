# 1428. Leftmost Column with at Least a One

## Solution 1 -- One pointer, starting from the top-right corner

* Time Complexity: O(N+M), where N is the length of the rows and M is the length of the columns.

* Space Complexity: O(1), for N depth of recursion

## Solution 2 -- Binary search

TODO:

* Time Complexity: O(NlogM), where N is the length of the rows and M is the length of the columns.

* Space Complexity: O(1)
