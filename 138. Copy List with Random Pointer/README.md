# 138. Copy List with Random Pointer

## Solution 1 -- Iterative

Use two pointers to deeply copy linked list. One is for the old list, another one is for the new list.

* Time Complexity: O(N)

* Space Complexity: O(N)

## Solution 2 -- Recursive

* Time Complexity: O(N)

* Space Complexity: O(N)

## Solution 3 -- Iterative (Improved from solution 1)

TODO:

* Time Complexity: O(N)

* Space Complexity: O(1)
