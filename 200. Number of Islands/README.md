# 200. Number of Islands

## Solution 1

Use DFS algorithm to recursively solve the problem

* Time Complexity: O(MxN)

* Space Complexity: O(MxN)

## Solution 2

Use BFS algorithm to solve the problem

* Time Complexity: O(MxN)

* Space Complexity: O(min(M, N)), BFS would visit each node based on the order entering the queue!
