# 226. Invert Binary Tree

## Solution 1

Recursively solve the problem

* Time Complexity: O(N)

* Space Complexity: O(H), H is the height of the tree, H is O(N)

## Solution 2

Apply DFS to solve the problem

* Time Complexity: O(N)

* Space Complexity: O(H), H is the height of the tree, H is O(N)

## Solution 3

Apply BFS to solve the problem

* Time Complexity: O(N)

* Space Complexity: O(N), it happens if the tree only has one layer
