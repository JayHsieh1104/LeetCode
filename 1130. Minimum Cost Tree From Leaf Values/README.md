# 1130. Minimum Cost Tree From Leaf Values

## Solution 1 -- Top-Down DP

* Time Complexity: O(N^3), where N is the length of the arr list.

* Space Complexity: O(N^2)

## Solution 2 -- Bottom-Up DP

* Time Complexity: O(N^3), where N is the length of the arr list.

* Space Complexity: O(N^2)

## Solution 3 -- Greedy

* Time Complexity: O(N^2), where N is the length of the arr list.

* Space Complexity: O(1)

## Solution 4 -- Monotonic stack

TODO:

* Time Complexity: O(N), where N is the length of the arr list.
